# Arduino-LCD-TFT
Shield 2.4" TFT Liquid Crystal Display Sketches. 
Arduino libaries used Adafruit_GFX.h and Adafruit_TFTLCD.h for the sketchs included.
Adafruit library for 8-bit TFT LCDs such as ILI9325, ILI9328, etc. This is a library for our Adafruit 16-channel PWM & Servo driver, shield or FeatherWing. Pick one up today in the adafruit shop! These displays use 8-bit parallel to communicate, 12 or 13 pins are required to interface (RST is optional). <link>https://github.com/adafruit/TFTLCD-Library</link>
